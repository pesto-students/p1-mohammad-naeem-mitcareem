# Problem Statement

Imagine a city of Chicago is getting built. You and your department are responsible for laying the roads and connectivity for Chicago with the rest of the United States. The problem your people ask you to address may not be precisely what they initially state. Consider if youâ€™re asked specifically to design a traffic roadway intersection. Your stated problem might be something like this:

***Design an intersection where two perpendicular roads meet. Both roads have one lane of traffic traveling in opposite directions. The intersection must meet minimum federal and state safety standards for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.***


Traffic Intersection Analysis:

1. Extend ground markings for cycle lanes through the conflict zone of the intersection, matching the width and positioning of the leading cycle lanes. Manage turns across the cycle track using a leading cycle/lagging left-turn phase. 

2. Where transit is in mixed traffic on the two-way street, avoid conflicts at transit stops by raising cycle lanes and changing markings. This helps to reduce cycling speeds and provide at-grade access to transit passengers. In such a configuration, cyclists must yield to pedestrians. 

3. On the one-way street, create pedestrian refuge islands in line with the parking lane to reduce pedestrian crossing distance. Where geometry allows, install refuge islands. 

4. Bus bulbs provide a dedicated space for passengers to wait, improving transit travel times with more efficient boarding. Far-side transit stops are preferred in conditions in which conflicts with turning vehicles are common. 

5. Provide turn lanes by introducing a recessed central median on the two-way street. Turn lanes provide protected turns across oncoming traffic.
